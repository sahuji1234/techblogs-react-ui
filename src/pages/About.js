          <p>These are great blogs to study</p>
          <p>
            Many blogs provide commentary on a particular subject or topic,
            ranging from philosophy, religion, and arts to science, politics,
            and sports. Others function as more personal online diaries or
            online brand advertising of a particular individual or company. A
            typical blog combines text, digital images, and links to other
            blogs, web pages, and other media related to its topic. The ability
            of readers to leave publicly viewable comments, and interact with
            other commenters, is an important contribution to the popularity of
            many blogs. However, blog owners or authors often moderate and
            filter online comments to remove hate speech or other offensive
            content. Most blogs are primarily textual, although some focus on
            art (art blogs), photographs (photoblogs), videos (video blogs or
            "vlogs"), music (MP3 blogs), and audio (podcasts). In education,
            blogs can be used as instructional resources; these are referred to
            as edublogs. Microblogging is another type of blogging, featuring
            very short posts.
